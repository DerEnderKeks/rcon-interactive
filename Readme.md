# rcon-interactive

This is a small rcon cli client written in nodejs.
I made this mainly for Factorio and I didn't test it for anything else yet.

> The code for this is a mess. Don't look at it.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -g rcon-interactive
```

## Usage

`rcon-interactive [<address[:port]> <password>]` - You can either pass address and password directly or enter it in the interactive REPL console.
